# Porter as a change-tracking tool — findings, approach, and review

Status: for review. Covers (1) how an upstream-delta is computed today, (2) the
measured delta from our pin to current `main`, (3) a full review of whether the
porter is geared to track upstream changes, (4) the one completeness hardening
shipped on this branch, and (5) a real latent incoherence that hardening
immediately surfaced. Policy lens throughout, per maintainer direction:
**never miss a real change; false positives are free; prefer simplicity.**

---

## 0. TL;DR

- The porter is an **airtight completeness ledger** for "am I still in exact sync
  with the pinned TS-Go source?" — `verify --strict-port` cannot pass with any
  stale / missing / orphan / duplicate / untracked unit or any generated-artifact
  drift. Behavioural change lives in func/method bodies, type defs, and const
  values, all of which are SHA-256 hashed per unit; nothing behavioural slips by.
- It is **not** a bump-*planner*: it has no "delta vs a candidate rev" mode, no
  per-unit diff, and no stale re-port / re-stamp assist. Those are ergonomic gaps,
  not completeness gaps — under the policy lens they do not matter and are
  deliberately **not** built.
- The delta to current `main` (285 commits / ~7 weeks) is **~610 real unit-actions**
  out of ~9,200 in-scope (~6.6%), concentrated in the checker — a normal batched
  bump. The scary raw "463 missing / 45 orphan" is >half phantom (a new
  host-native watch library + moves).
- There **was** exactly one place a real change could hide behind a green gate:
  the AST schema dir holds verbatim copies of source files, validated against the
  *copies*, never against live source. This branch closes it with a byte-sync
  check.
- That check immediately caught a **real pre-existing incoherence**: the schema
  copy of `symbolflags.go` is pinned ahead of the source pin, and the AST
  generator baked the newer symbol-merge masks into `generated/flags.ts`. Runtime
  is unaffected (the binder uses the hand-ported `ast/symbolflags.ts`), but the
  generated duplicate disagrees with its source. Reconciliation is a content
  decision (below), intentionally not bundled into the tooling change.

## 1. Context

- **Pin:** TS-Go submodule at `515d036f` (2026-04-24).
- **Upstream `main`:** `c78d39e7` (2026-06-12) — **285 commits / ~7 weeks ahead**.
- The port is ~13.6k catalogued units; ~9.2k in-scope (the rest excluded:
  LS / lsp / api / project / format / tests). Each in-scope unit carries a
  `@tsgo-unit` header with the SHA-256 `sigHash`/`bodyHash` of its Go source at
  port time.

## 2. How an upstream delta is computed today

The porter has **no dedicated bump/delta command** — but its comparison engine is
already rev-agnostic. `buildStatus()` simply reconciles "Go units at
`config.sourceRoot`" against "`@tsgo-unit` hashes in our TS source." Nothing pins
`sourceRoot` to the current checkout except a config string. So the delta was
produced by pointing that engine at a new rev:

1. `git fetch` in the submodule (objects only; no checkout moved).
2. `git worktree add --detach <new-rev>` — materialise the new tree beside the pin.
3. A ~40-line driver (`.analysis/porter-delta/delta.mjs`): load `porter.config.json`,
   override `sourceRoot` → the worktree, call the exported `runScan` (hash Go units
   at the new rev) + `scanTsUnits` (our pin-time header hashes) + `buildStatus`.

Output was validated against ground truth by hand (fswatch is real-and-new;
nodeflags drift is real; `isJSDocTypedefTag` genuinely gone). **The capability to
track across revs already exists; only a convenience flag is missing.**

### How "current inventory" is known
No stored database — the **source files are the inventory**. `scanTsUnits()` walks
`packages/tsts/src` on every run, regex-extracts every `@tsgo-unit {…}` header, and
that reconstructed set is "what we have + which Go hash each was ported against."
The Go side is likewise re-extracted fresh each run. It is fresh-vs-fresh
reconciliation every time; there is no cache to go stale. A ported unit missing its
header → its Go unit shows `missing` (flagged); a file that should carry headers but
has none → `untracked` (flagged).

## 3. The measured delta (pin → `c78d39e7`)

| Bucket | Raw | Real (phantoms removed) |
|---|---:|---|
| implemented (hashes match) | 8,797 | — no work |
| **stale** (sig/body drift) | 395 | 395 to review |
| **missing** (new Go units) | 463 | **193** |
| **orphan** (gone upstream) | 45 | **~21** |
| excluded (out-of-scope) | 16,281 | — |
| parse errors | 0 | — |

Phantom reconciliation:
- **270 of 463 "missing"** are one new module — `internal/fswatch`, a vendored
  fsnotify fork (Linux fanotify, macOS FSEvents, debounce) used only by
  `execute/watcher` + `lsp`. Host-native, same class as `vfs/vfswatch` (already
  out-of-scope). It **replaces** `vfswatch`, which accounts for **16 of the 45
  orphans**. → the entire watch story is a host-native swap = a config policy line,
  ~0 port work.
- **8 more orphans** are scanner unicode/identifier helpers **moved** to a new
  `internal/stringutil/identifier.go` + generated tables — a relocation, not a
  deletion (pairs with ~20 stringutil "missing").
- **~21 genuine** helper deletions/inlines (`isJSDocTypedefTag`,
  `getSetAccessorValueParameter` ×2, etc.).

Stale concentration: checker **174**, transformers 62, tsoptions 23, printer 22,
parser 20, scanner 18, … (checker is where TS's type-system fixes land).

**stale ≠ effort.** A unit flags on any AST-structural drift. Example from
`checker.go`: `getNarrowedTypeOfSymbol`'s whole change is `(core.IfElse(…))` →
`core.IfElse(…)` (a paren removal) — flagged, ~0 work; while right beside it,
genuinely new `addDiagnostic`/`addSuggestionDiagnostic` guarding recursion depth
is a real port. Total checker churn over the window: 21 files, +1,595/−467.

Generated-artifact delta: diagnostics catalog **0 new codes** (2,153=2,153, regen
≈ no-op); `nodeflags.go` +6 lines (small AST regen); bundled libs no new files.

**Real work ≈ 395 stale (mostly trivial) + 193 missing + ~21 cleanup ≈ ~610
unit-actions**, well-localised in the checker. A normal batched bump — days, not a
re-port.

## 4. Is the porter geared to track changes? (review)

Engine: a Go extractor (`go-extractor/main.go`) hashes every unit as **SHA-256 over
`go/printer`-canonicalised AST** (sig = signature; body = full decl), walking **all
`.go` files regardless of build tags** (platform variants covered). The Node driver
compares against `@tsgo-unit` header hashes. `verify --strict-port` fails on any
stale / missing (strict) / orphan / duplicate Go|TS ID / untracked|forbidden TS
file / generated-artifact drift, and enforces stub/throw discipline.

### Strengths (keep)
1. **Hard completeness gate** — cannot pass with unaddressed drift.
2. **Canonical-AST hashing** — pure gofmt/whitespace reflow does not false-flag.
3. **All-build-tag scan** — platform files tracked, not dropped.
4. Scope-policy engine; generated-artifact content-hashing; scaffold for new units;
   iota/const-value resolution.

### Gaps — and how they rank under "never miss / FP-free / simple"
Most gaps are **false-positive reduction or ergonomics** → explicitly *not worth
building*; leaving them out keeps the tool simpler, and over-reporting is the safe
direction:
- **Move/rename detection** — a move = orphan + missing = both flagged. No miss.
- **ID fragility** (path-embedded IDs; constGroup ID = concatenation of all member
  names, so adding one flag re-IDs the group) — produces orphan+missing pairs. Noise.
- **Comment quirk** — empirically the body hash drops inline comments (a
  behaviourally-inert blind spot) and includes-but-mis-positions doc comments
  (doc-only edits over-report). No behavioural miss.
- **No per-unit diff / no `delta --against` command / honor-system re-stamp** —
  ergonomics + a process rule (verify-clean is never trusted alone; always paired
  with the byte-exact corpus gate).

**Genuine completeness risks** (the only ones that matter under the lens):
- **(a) Schema-dir copies can silently lag live source.** The AST schema inputs
  (`schema/tsgo/{nodeflags,symbolflags}.go`, `ast.json`, `ast.schema.json`) are
  hand-copied and pinned on a *separate* track; `verify` checks generated artifacts
  against those copies, not against live source. Diagnostics and bundled-lib checks
  already read live source, so the AST schema is the lone exception. **→ closed on
  this branch (§5).**
- **(b) Corpus discovery must stay dynamic.** Verified: `discoverCases()` walks the
  testdata tree (`walkFiles`) with no frozen manifest, so new upstream cases
  auto-run byte-exact against their new baselines. New behaviour cannot be silently
  skipped. Must never regress to a static list.

Acknowledged inherent blind spots (not worth fixing): compat-layer/facade drift
(`go/*.ts` is authored, not ported — surfaces later as a port/compile error); no
per-unit source-rev provenance; pure behavioural const-value ripple referenced by
name (rare; caught by baselines).

**Bottom line:** for completeness the porter is sound — behavioural changes live in
hashed unit bodies; the strict gate forces every one to be addressed; the corpus
gate independently re-checks behaviour against dynamically-discovered new baselines.
The missing half is planning/assist, which the policy lens says not to build.

## 5. The hardening shipped (this branch)

`feat/porter-schema-source-sync-check` (commit `d0934b0a`).

`buildSchemaSourceSyncStatus(config)`: for each declared `{schema, source}` pair,
assert the schema-dir copy is byte-identical (CRLF-normalised) to its live source
file under `config.sourceRoot`; fail `verify` on any mismatch. Config-driven
(`schemaSourceSyncChecks`), so new copies are covered without code. Surfaced in
`printStatus` and `collectVerifyFailures`. Bias toward over-reporting (any byte
difference fails) per policy. 4 new tests; `porter:test` 46/46.

This closes risk (a): the schema pin can no longer silently lag the source pin.

## 6. The incoherence the check immediately caught

Running it on the current pin flags **1 mismatch: `symbolflags.go`** — a real,
pre-existing issue that was sitting behind a green gate:

- `schema/tsgo/symbolflags.go` is pinned **ahead** (`879968116c`, May 20) of the
  source submodule (`515d036f`, Apr 24). The only content difference across that
  range is `symbolflags.go`'s symbol-merge exclusion masks, e.g.
  `GetAccessorExcludes = Value & ^SetAccessor` (source) →
  `Value & ^(SetAccessor | Property)` (schema).
- The AST generator consumes `schema/tsgo/symbolflags.go`, so it baked the newer
  masks into `generated/flags.ts` (`SymbolFlagsPropertyExcludes = 13243`, etc.).
- **But the live binder imports the masks from the hand-ported
  `ast/symbolflags.ts`** (`@tsgo-unit` at `515d036f`, `Value & ~Property`), not from
  `generated/flags.ts`. So **runtime behaviour is correct** for the pin (consistent
  with the full suite passing) — the generated file is a **divergent duplicate**.

This is exactly the never-miss value of the new check: a generated type-system
constant that disagrees with its source, with no active runtime symptom, now made
impossible to miss.

### Recommended resolution (content decision — not bundled here)
Bring the schema/generated artifacts back into coherence with the pin:
- Copy live-source (`515d036f`) `symbolflags.go` → `schema/tsgo/symbolflags.go`,
  regenerate AST (`porter:ast --write --force`) so `generated/flags.ts` matches the
  hand-ported `ast/symbolflags.ts`, and update `schema/tsgo/VERSION.md`.
- Expected to be behaviourally inert (the live path already uses the hand-ported
  515d036f masks), but should be confirmed by `source:test` + the current-corpus
  byte-exact gate before merge.
- Alternatively, fold it into the upcoming pin bump (which moves source forward to
  where the schema already is), reconciling both at the new rev.

Either way it is a deliberate content change requiring sign-off, not a tooling edit.

## 7. Recommendations / next steps

1. **Merge the sync check** (this branch). Note it makes `verify` correctly red
   until §6 is reconciled — that red is the check doing its job.
2. **Reconcile `symbolflags`/`flags.ts`** per §6 (or via the bump). Greens the gate
   and removes the divergent generated duplicate.
3. **Schedule the pin bump soon.** 7 weeks / 285 commits is on the high side; each
   delay grows the stale count and baseline drift, and Tsonic-TSTS landing is a
   forcing function to stay near TS 7.0 head. Real surface is ~610 well-localised
   units; budget a few focused days.
4. **Optional, low priority** (ergonomics only; skip unless a bump proves painful):
   a `porter delta --against <rev>` wrapper around the existing engine (the
   `.analysis` driver is a working prototype). Not a completeness need.

## Appendix — verification artifacts

- Delta driver + full lists: `.analysis/porter-delta/` (gitignored working area).
- New-rev worktree: `.analysis/porter-delta/tsgo-c78d39e7` (detached; pin untouched).
- Gate results on the memory-fixed dist (prior task, for context): submodule
  compiler 7,275/7,275 and conformance 7,694/7,694, 0 failures; peak RSS 2.26 GB.
- This branch: `porter:test` 46/46; `porter status` reports
  `Schema/source sync mismatches: 1` (symbolflags), `verify` fails with
  `1 schema/source sync mismatches (symbolflags.go)` — the intended catch.
